wrapping or non wrap

rows

columns

interconnectivity

potential paths

make a single set of each coordinate first

pick random path from list paths and make sets of those coordinates

at the same time delete those from paths

once this is over, take interconnectivity and assign paths from leftover


setofedges initially each node is a set in itself

choose random edges from potential paths and make them on edge

edges may be repeated, but instead make another LEFTOVER set which consists of these edges

representation of the dungeon before assiging cave or tunnel

create dungeon in the construtor itself if possible

use toString to represent it

after joining, make each node as a tunnel if they have tone entry and one exit

add treasure randomly to caves

player start location

decsription of treasure collected by player

description of players location, moves and treasure in the cave


the path between the start and end cave must be greater than 5 (this should be the shortest path)

tunnel can be start or end location



test cases

check for row, column

check for row and column for minimum distance (i.e. if row and column < 3 then the whole dungeon is invalid)

tunnel has 2 entrances, cave has 1,3,4

test dungeon for exactly one path (interconnectivity 0)

interconnecticity increase, path increase

wrapping, non-wrapping of dungeon

start cave and end cave shortest path

treasure added to 20% of caves

cave has more than one treasure

player created after dungeon created

player to start from start

describe player after moving

describe location after moving from one cave to other

reach destination 

player to pick treasure and its updated

player at start do not have anything


	



Part 2

atleast one monster in end cave, specified on command line, none at start cave

monster only occupy caves

if cave has 1 monster and player 2 position away from that cave, less pungent
if cave has
	1 monster 1 position away 
	2 or more monster 2 position away
	

Player has arrows
3 arrows in start and then can find in cave or tunnel 

distance - number of caves to travel
direction - arrow can enter into tunnel and exit from anywhere
in cave they can only leave in opposite direction

distance must be exact

monster is dead if 2 hits by player,
if only hit by 1, player has 50% chance or escaping



test cases

number of monsters less than cave

monsters are not present in tunnel
